# Expanse Bundle Library
This is a sub-module for the client application, as well as any asset-bundles the client may load. 

## Behavours
Behaviours in this reprository can be compiled into the the Expanse client, and then can be used/attached on Prefabs in asset-bundles loaded into an Expanse. 

## Asset Manifest
This contains the asset-manifest structures the client uses to identify prefabs to instantiate in an expanse.
It also contains tools for creating Expanse bundle-manifests to register asset-bundle assets with the client/expanse.
